Problem-solving and decomposition involves
- Understand a plan
- Devise a Plan

Defining the problem

Take in consideration that we only define the problem and the goal, you should not think in algorithm or logical mind in this step, just keep in mind the final result in details, not in a general view.

- Restarting the problem in your own words.
- Use pictures and diagrams.
- Make the unknowns explicit.
