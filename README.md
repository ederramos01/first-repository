Problem-solving and decomposition involves
- Understand a plan
- Devise a Plan

## Defining the problem

Take in consideration that we only define the problem and the goal, you should not think in algorithm or logical mind in this step, just keep in mind the final result in details, not in a general view.

- Restarting the problem in your own words.
- Use pictures and diagrams.
- Make the unknowns explicit.

## Devising a solution: something to keep in mind

Firstly, there is no one solution, there can be a bunch of possible solutions, however itâ€™s necessary to find the best one. And then, to seek a solution, you can describe the problem louder, or describe the steps with a coworker or with a brainstorm. Finally, once you have a group of steps, you can order them or find the best solution, if the model is inaccurate, you may need to go back just a couple steps, or nearer to the beginning to find the best solution.
